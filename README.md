# ComfyUI - quadmoon's Nodes

## Introduction

This is a repository of all the nodes I wanted to have but couldn't find anywhere. I am quite happy with them and will update this repo as I fix bugs and create new nodes. Enjoy!

## Features

### Existing Nodes
* **The BUTTON** - A one-stop-shop for cancelling your queue or rebooting ComfyUI entirely. Something gone wrong with your setup? Hit ***The BUTTON***. It will take care of everything for you. Use responsibly.
* **CLIP External Text Encoder** - Your regular `CLIP Text Encoder` node but the text to encode with CLIP defaults to an input instead of a text box. No more right-clicking and converting the text to an input!

### Planned Nodes
* **X to String Converters** - Need to incorporate a value into a string? Maybe a filename input automation? Need to do some math and output the result into a text display? Convert it to a string and easily output it to whatever nodes you need. It even works with the [ComfyMath](https://github.com/evanspearman/ComfyMath) nodes by [evanspearman](https://github.com/evanspearman)!  (***WIP***)

## Installation

Install through ComfyUI Manager (Install via GIT URL)

1. `cd custom_nodes`
2. `git clone https://github.com/traugdor/ComfyUI-quadMoons-nodes.git`
3. Reboot ComfyUI

### Uninstallation
To uninstall **ComfyUI-quadMoons-nodes**, browse to your `custom_nodes` folder and delete the `\ComfyUI-quadMoons-nodes` folder. Reboot ComfyUI.

*quadMoon's Nodes* is part of the ComfyUI ecosystem. It is my hope that you are able to incorporate most, if not all, of my nodes into your workflows. Enjoy!
